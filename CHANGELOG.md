# Changelog

All notable repository-release changes are tracked here. The main
[README.md](./README.md) describes the current baseline; historical release
notes live in this file.

## 0.6.1 - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- Reworked `decimal_checked` into an IEEE context-and-flags pipeline and added
  `decimal_gda_checked` for sticky-context composition, trap short-circuiting,
  defined results, and explicit recovery.
- Consolidated public tooling under parameterized `just conformance`, `just
  gate`, and `just bench` commands and removed the backend-specific aliases.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- Rebuilt the package documentation matrix across English, Simplified Chinese,
  and Japanese. Every package now has API, tutorial, design, and package README
  coverage; numerical cores have explicit conformance and performance evidence
  pages, and superseded research notes have been consolidated.
- Split IEEE tininess policy from GDA status handling; IEEE contexts default to
  after-rounding and expose an explicit before-rounding choice.
- Reject non-positive public precision and reserve zero-precision arithmetic for
  private exact work contexts.
- Added GDA contexts with radix, sticky flags, trap sets, signal precedence, and
  `GdaOutcome` defined results.
- Removed implementation-specific IEEE oracle and full-vector download paths;
  checked-in DPD/BID fixtures are validated from IEEE encoding formulas.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Added `BinCoeff`, the non-negative public coefficient boundary for binary
  floating-point, IEEE interchange bits, and ball arithmetic. It provides
  explicit integer/byte parsing, arithmetic, bit operations, division, and
  conversion without exposing MoonBit `BigInt`.
- Added a pure inline/limb coefficient kernel for non-JS targets and a hidden
  host `bigint` adapter for JavaScript behind the same `BinCoeff` API.

### Changed

- Reworked contextual integer powers around a single approximation with a
  conservative dyadic error enclosure and exact can-round checks, retaining
  the exact coefficient-power implementation as the permanent fallback.
- Added leading-bit coefficient exponentiation, small addition chains,
  power-of-two and bounded exact-result dispatches, and 120 fixed MPFR 4.2.2
  `pow_si` witnesses without changing the public rounding semantics.
- Changed `BinFloat`, `BinFloatResult`, `BallFloat`, and `BallFloatResult`
  constructors and accessors to use `BinCoeff` plus an independent sign.
- Changed `BinaryInterchange::bits` and `from_bits` to use `BinCoeff`.
- Renamed the checked-composition wrapper packages with the `_checked` suffix
  to align package paths with the checked arithmetic trait naming.
- Kept the existing Decimal and Semantic `BigInt` APIs unchanged; the migration
  applies only to the binary and ball stacks.

### Removed

- Removed binary-stack `from_bigint` constructors, `BinFloat::significand`, and
  the `NatHomomorphism` / `IntegralHomomorphism` implementations whose public
  boundary depended on `BigInt`. Use `from_coefficient`, `coefficient`, and
  explicit `negative?` arguments instead.

## 0.4.1 - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- Refreshed the published package README and current-baseline entry points so
  Mooncakes displays the 0.4 release documentation and installation version.
- Recorded verified full-corpus results for both the current and legacy GDA
  suites: 81,110 executable cases passed with zero failures.

### Changed

- Moved `Decoration` and `BallFloatDecorated` into the `ball_float` package so
  bare and decorated IEEE 1788 interval APIs share one package boundary.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-07-11

Feature baseline for Decimal contexts and GDA conformance.

### Added

- Added `DecimalContext`, `DecimalFlags`, decimal-specific rounding modes, and
  context-aware arithmetic, classification, formatting, unary, extrema,
  adjacent-value, logical-digit, quantize/rescale, and elementary operations.
- Added decimal32, decimal64, and decimal128 interchange encoding through
  `DecimalInterchange` and `DecimalInterchangeFormat`.
- Added signed-zero, quiet/signaling NaN, payload, total-order, quantum, normal,
  and subnormal Decimal observers.
- Added `numeric_expr`, a private expression representation with callback-driven
  evaluation and source spans.
- Added `gda_expr` and `gda_expr_cli` for runtime parsing and execution of GDA
  `.decTest` documents, deterministic sharding, case filtering, structured
  summaries, and native CLI execution.
- Added `semantic`, which projects concrete numeric values and arithmetic errors
  into representation-independent scalar, interval, and error values.
- Added pinned external conformance-corpus metadata, a checked-in smoke fixture,
  staged interpreter tooling, and focused CI coverage.

### Changed

- Decimal parsing can preserve exponent/quantum; canonicalization is now an
  explicit `normalized()` or context reduction step.
- Repository validation now separates the focused CI white-box gate from the
  full local/release GDA conformance gate.
- Documentation now follows the package-oriented, current-baseline structure of
  `linear-algebra`, with aligned English, Chinese, and Japanese file sets.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-06-12

### Highlights

- Added `bin_float_result`, `decimal_result`, and `ball_float_result` as closed
  checked-composition wrappers around concrete numeric values.
- Added the first semantic projection layer.
- Integrated shared checked arithmetic capabilities from `Luna-Flow/arithmetic`
  and shared algebraic abstractions from `Luna-Flow/luna-generic`.
- Narrowed `Floating` to classification, sign, precision, precision retuning,
  and normalization; arithmetic capabilities remain separate.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-06-07

### Highlights

- Introduced the shared arithmetic capability boundary.
- Added the first explicit dependency on `Luna-Flow/arithmetic`.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-06-07

### Highlights

- Added the initial ecosystem dependencies needed by the floating-point types.
- Prepared the first maintenance release of the original API line.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-06-06

### Highlights

- Established the MoonBit module and the first arbitrary-precision binary,
  decimal, and ball arithmetic packages.
